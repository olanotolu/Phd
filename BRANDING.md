# TLM Branding & Naming Guide

## Architecture Name

**Thermodynamic Language Model (TLM)**

## System / Engine Name

**The Babel Engine**

(Implementation of TLM, inspired by the Library of Babel)

---

## Short Technical Description

- "A physics-inspired language model that represents text as an energy landscape and generates patterns via thermodynamic sampling."
- "A discrete energy-based language model that discovers structure in symbolic sequences."

## Tagline Ideas

Pick 1–2 depending on audience:

1. **"From chaos to structure."** ⭐ (Recommended)
2. **"Language as an energy landscape."**
3. **"Thermodynamic models for symbolic intelligence."**
4. **"We don't predict text. We stabilize it."**
5. **"Pattern discovery in pure noise."**
6. **"Where physics meets language."**
7. **"From Babel to balance."**

## Key Differentiators

### vs. Transformers

| Transformer | TLM |
|------------|-----|
| Next-token prediction | Whole-sequence energy |
| Autoregressive generation | Parallel sampling |
| Logits → probabilities | Energy → stability |
| Deterministic (with temperature) | Inherently stochastic |
| Trained on next-token loss | Trained on sequence energy |

### vs. Other EBMs

| Traditional EBM | TLM |
|-----------------|-----|
| Continuous variables | Discrete (symbolic) |
| Image/vision focus | Text/language focus |
| Real-valued energy | Discrete energy landscape |
| Score matching | Pseudo-likelihood / KL-gradient |

## Messaging Framework

### For Researchers

"TLM introduces a new paradigm for language modeling that treats text as a thermodynamic system. Instead of predicting tokens, we model the stability of entire sequences through energy-based factors."

### For Practitioners

"Babel Engine demonstrates how energy-based models can discover structure in symbolic sequences, even when trained on pure noise. This is a proof-of-concept for future thermodynamic language models."

### For General Audience

"Can a computer find meaning in chaos? TLM shows how structure can emerge from random text through physics-inspired energy modeling."

## Visual Identity

### Color Scheme (Suggestions)

- **Primary**: Deep blue (energy, stability)
- **Secondary**: Orange/red (heat, temperature)
- **Accent**: White/light gray (text, clarity)

### Logo Concept

- Energy landscape visualization
- Text characters forming a structure
- Thermodynamic symbols (temperature, energy)

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"TLM is a new type of language model that doesn't predict the next word. Instead, it assigns an energy to entire sequences and uses thermodynamic sampling to generate structured text. We've built Babel Engine v0.1 as a proof-of-concept that shows how order can emerge from chaos—even when trained on pure random text. It's the first step toward physics-inspired language models that naturally fit probabilistic hardware like Extropic."
