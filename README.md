# Thermodynamic Language Model (TLM) — Babel Engine v0.1

**TLM** is a physics-inspired language model that represents text as an energy landscape and generates structure via thermodynamic sampling, instead of standard next-token prediction.

This repo contains **Babel Engine v0.1** — a character-level Thermodynamic Language Model trained on random "Library of Babel"–style text to demonstrate how **order can emerge from chaos**.

## 🌡️ What is a Thermodynamic Language Model?

A **Thermodynamic Language Model (TLM)** is an energy-based model over symbolic sequences:

- Each character position is a **discrete variable**.
- Local **factors** (e.g. bigrams) define an **energy** for each sequence.
- **Gibbs / block sampling** is used to move from random noise to low-energy, structured configurations.

Instead of predicting the next token like a Transformer, a TLM asks:

> **"How stable is this whole sequence?"**

**Low energy = stable / structured**  
**High energy = unstable / unlikely**

## 🔬 What this repo shows (v0.1)

Babel Engine v0.1 demonstrates:

- Training a **discrete energy-based model (EBM)** on random text.
- Using **Gibbs sampling** to generate new sequences.
- Quantitatively comparing:
  - pure random text ("Library of Babel" noise) vs
  - TLM-generated samples

Despite being trained on noise, the TLM learns to:

- form **repeating patterns** (motifs)
- stabilize certain bigrams and clusters
- converge to **attractor states** (low-energy sequences)

In other words, the model starts to create **structure out of chaos**.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

v0.1 is a **character-level** Thermodynamic Language Model with:

- **Alphabet**: `a–z`, space, comma, period (29 characters)
- **Nodes**: one discrete variable per sequence position
- **Factors**: bigram interactions between neighboring characters
- **Energy**: sum of local factor energies
- **Sampler**: block Gibbs sampling
- **Training**: pseudo-likelihood over observed sequences

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture specification.

See [`example.py`](./example.py) for a full run.

git clone https://github.com/yourname/tlm-babel.git
cd tlm-babel
pip install -r requirements.txt

python example.py
```

You should see output like:

- training progress over epochs
- final data and model energies
- pattern statistics for:
  - random data
  - TLM samples
- sample sequences generated by the TLM

## 🧠 Why this matters

This project is a **prototype** for a new family of language models:

- **Thermodynamic Language Models (TLMs)**
  - represent text with energy, not logits
  - generate via sampling, not direct prediction
  - naturally fit future **probabilistic hardware** (e.g. Extropic)

Babel Engine v0.1 is a **minimal proof-of-concept**:

> A small EBM over characters can learn to create stable, repeating patterns even when trained on pure random text.

This is the **first step** toward thermodynamic language models and physics-inspired symbolic intelligence.

## 🚧 Roadmap

Planned directions:

- **v0.2** — Train on real text (Wikipedia / domain-specific corpora)
- **v0.3** — Multi-scale factors (bigrams + trigrams + span-level)
- **v0.4** — Better training (contrastive divergence, KL gradients)
- **v0.5** — Anomaly detection on LLM outputs using TLM energy
